    "## Objective \n",
    "\n",
    "Recent US financial market developements have caused the market to begin pricing a potential recession by 2019-end and thus, a change in Fed Monetary Policy towards a more accommodative approach, including rate cuts and stopping balance sheet normalization by Q3 of 2019. The purpose of this small document is to review current consecutive-hike spread (or Pc-Bias) strategies, involving Quarterly and a Non-Quarterly meetings, to determine wether we can trade them successfully on the current and future potential curve environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Some brief background on \"Press Conference Bias\"\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the Press Conference Bias? Simply put, a bias for monetary policy action towards quarterly meetings (March, June, September and December meetings), this bias is currently taken into account by the market when pricing rate moves. \n",
    "\n",
    "To find out when this bias was born, we first have to go back to 2011, when on April 27th, Fed Chair Bernanke gave the first post-FOMC meeting press conference in the history of the Federal Reserve (you can see it [here]). This new monetary policy communication tool was not scheduled regularly at the beginning, therefore the Fed Chair would appear before the press whenever there was a need to communicate with the public. As the Fed continued polishing its communication tools, and forward guidance gained traction, by 2013, these press conferences became regularly held on quarterly meetings. \n",
    "\n",
    "FOMC members individual projections were also released to the public only on press conference meetings, so this schedule eventually gave the market the idea that quarterly meetings were more relevant for monetary policy action, and thus the \"press conference bias\" was eventually fully priced in by the market by the second half of 2014. As the most recent rate-hike cycle began, the bias was confirmed by the Fed, as every single rate move from 2015 through 2018 was done on a quarterly meeting. \n",
    "\n",
    "On June 13th of 2018, Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced that the Fed would be holding a press conference on every meeting. He made sure to remark that the decision was only aimed at improving communication, and that it had no other implications regarding monetary policy, so the market reaction over time was to continue pricing the bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "[here]: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcpresconf20110427.htm\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "We are not going to look at consecutive spreads, or flies, broadly, but only focusing on a specific set of them. Here we outline the conditions a fly has to meet to be considered into this analysis: \n",
    "\n",
    ">- **Shorts only (recommended):** We are exclusively looking to consider spreads were we can short the non-quarterly meeting vs the adjacent quarterly meeting. \n",
    ">\n",
    "> \n",
    ">- **Fixed structure:** Non-Quarterly meeting as the first leg always, followed by the Quarterly meeting afterwards.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- **No December:** Excluding flies that have any December hike as one of their legs.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- **2020 Spreads (recommended):** Focusing on 2020 flies, where the curve is the smoothest.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why look at these strategies now?\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind these strategies is that, after the rate crash and curve flattening that proceeded the shift in FedSpeak back in November 2018, the curve has smoothened somewhat and that it might smoothen even further, particularly on the back end (2020). \n",
    "\n",
    "Under this current curve environment, the market is pricing a rate-cut cycle, with cuts seemingly being priced on every consecutive meeting, smoothing out the curve as a consequence. This smooth curve hypothesis, wether it has a positive slope with rate cuts or is completely flat with no rate moves priced in, favours this particular set of flies, as they can perform on the following potential scenarios: \n",
    "\n",
    ">- Mean reversion around a flat curve.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- Positive (smooth) slope with rate cuts being priced consecutively (with no PC-bias), level independent. \n",
    ">\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- Monetary policy shift back to rate hikes, with PC-bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course these spreads can fail, here are some of the potential scenarios where they can underperform and break down:\n",
    "\n",
    ">- Positive (non-smooth) slope with rate cuts being priced predominantly on quarterly meetings (PC-Bias). \n",
    ">\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- Monetary policy shift back to rate hikes, without PC-Bias (smooth negative sloped curve)."

    "\n",

Remember that post-FOMC Meeting press conferences were already introduced by 2012, fixed on quarterly meetings by 2013, and fully priced by the market by the second half of 2014. \n",

    ">- **Aggregated Data Histograms:** We aggregate all of our 180 days to maturity data (all of the spreads) and plot their distribution, we do this for consecutive and jumping spreads separatedly.

    ">\n",

    ">- **Aggregated Data Day to Maturity Time Series:** This is simply an aggregation of individual spreads day to maturity time series, we do it by creating an equally weighted \"portfolio\" of all consecutive spreads and repeat the same process for jumping spreads, its a summary of what we saw individually for each spread on their corresponding day to maturity time series. \n",

    "The smooth positive slope and lack of PC-bias on this period meant that shorting hike spreads (consecutive or jumping) was very comfortable. Their fair price was close to zero the flatter the curve got, mispricings were small and volatility was low as well. This is the kind of curve scenario were these spreads behave the best, with no big shocks, mean reversion and favorable rolldown with hikes expiring near or below zero. \n",

    "On this period the PC-bias starts getting priced in, plus the curve starts to flatten as hike expectations move closer to the front. Higher front-end volatility and the potential for Non-quarterly meetings snapping above its quarterly pairs in the front-end make for harder-to-trade spreads, and even harder to hold due to the potential for the non-quarterly leg getting skewed once it gets closer to expiration. We begin seeing differences between consecutive and jumping spreads, as the PC-bias begins settling in. Also we experience for the first time Non quarterly meetings getting skewed in the front end, we will talk about this later. "

As a result, the curve inverts completely and the PC-bias becomes fully priced in. Non-Quarterly meetings are discarded pretty much completely and these spreads become virtually one-legged, as most of their price is set by the Quarterly meeting leg hike expectations. This is the worst scenario for these spreads, the \"danger-zone\", as there is no effective hedging, volatility is huge and we are basically trading naked Quarterly meetings."

    "\n",
    "Fast forward to our current curve environment, we take a look at consecutive spreads and see what we can infer from that. We mentioned at the beginning of the document that developements outside the US, a change in tone on Fed Official's speeches and weak US economic data on Q4 2018 caused the market to abruptly change its view on the rate hike cycle and begin pricing a potential recession and rate cuts on the back-end.\n",
    "\n",
    "The movement peaked around Christmas and the curve settled after that with a newish shape [`(Figure 9)`](#Figure_9), after having pretty much completely wiped out hike expectations. Our base case is that as long as a recession and a rate-cut cycle are priced on the back end, the curve could have a smooth enough slope to allow us to trade these consecutive spreads, in addition to jumping hike spreads, as rate cuts could be priced in a consecutive fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then look at what has happened with these spreads since the Christmas rally and try to draw some conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lets take a look at the data\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be splitting consecutive spreads between 2019 and 2020 (F19H19 to Q19U19 and F20H20 to N20U20), as well as 2012-2014 spreads (aggregated data only, for the list of spreads go back to the third section). For simplicity's sake, we will refer to Non-Quarterly meetings as NoPc meetings, and Quarterly meetings as Pc meetings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">- **How we will be looking at it:**  We are going to be using time series and aggregated spread data histograms.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- **What are we looking for?:**  We are looking for differences between 2019 and 2020 spreads, if any. And to draw a line towards consecutive spreads on the Pre-Hiking Cycle stage we defined earlier, and see if there is any resemblance. \n",
    ">\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- **Samples:**  For current spreads, we are looking at data from January 2019 up to the most recent data available. For 2012-2014 spreads we will be looking at 180 trading days to maturity aggregated data. Because current spreads have smaller samples than 2012-2014 spreads, we are normalizing the histogram to avoid scaling issues."

    "As soon as we look at current spreads time series since the Christmas rally [`(Figure 26)`](#Figure_25) we can clearly see there is an abrupt break for 2019 spreads by the end of March, triggered by a very dovish Fed (March FOMC meeting Statement and Economic projections, with 3 less hikes for 2019-2020 relative to the previous release) and weak Euro area PMI data. Both K19M19 and Q19U19 jumped by about 2 to 3 basis points in a market move prompted by a large drop on M19, U19 and Z19 as the market panicked and begun pricing te possibility of tactical cuts for 2019, without the need of clear signs of recession. \n",
    "\n",
    "2020 spreads, on the other hand, have shown resilience during the March event and a much more stable path, at least so far, similar to what we saw for consecutive spreads on the Pre-Hiking Cycle stage (2012-2014). This makes them more appealing as the slope of the curve on 2020 has remained smoother in spite of the March panic. We will be looking a bit closer at the March event later. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we look at their historical distributions [`(Figure 25)`](#Figure_25) we can confirm the same: 2019 spreads distribution is heavily skewed, with a huge right side tail due to spreads breaking after the March event. 2020 spreads have a more symetric distribution that has some resemblance to the 2012-2014 consecutive spreads distribution (black line), although much flatter, whether it moves closer to 2012-2014 or 2019 spreads will depend on the way the market considers Pc-bias as the curve rolls forward. \n",

    "Considering what was mentioned above, we can then split, at least for now, 2019 and 2020 consecutive spreads and summarize as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    ">- **2019 Spreads (F19H19 to Q19U19):** In spite of the Fed eliminating the Quarterly-meeting-only press conference pattern, the PC-bias remains priced in on 2019 to this day, but with a flatter curve and rate cuts. The curve resembles the transition sub-period of H2 2014 through 2016, that is, a flat curve with PC-bias and positive/flat slope. These spreads are rather unpredictable, quite volatile relative to their 2020 peers, and still very exposed to the Quarterly meeting leg.  \n",
    ">\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- **2020 Spreads (F20H20 to N20U20):** We have observed so far that the market is persistently pricing a smoother positve sloped curve for 2020 with fading PC-bias, likely related to recession and emergency (consecutive) rate cuts expectations. This section of the curve resembles the Pre-hiking cycle scenario, and so far spreads have behaved very similarly to their 2012-2014 counterparts. It is still early to tell and PC-bias could easily be back on the curve under several potential scenarios (tactical cuts, back to rate hikes, mainly). "

    "## What Happens if a Non-Quarterly Meeting Gets Skewed?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some background\n",
    "\n",
    "During the Transition to a full Hiking Cycle stage (2015 through 2016), in spite of the Press Conference Bias being fully priced in by the market, as the cycle had not began fully, some Non-Quarterly meetings from April 2015 onward got skewed relative to their adjacent Quarterly meetings.The full list included: Apr15, Jul15, Oct15, Apr16 and Jul16. \n",
    "\n",
    "Back then the market was expecting the beginning of the cycle and an imminent rate hike that could come any meeting. In spite of the PC-bias being taken into consideration, whenever the market expected a rate hike on the front-end, it would skew the first Non-Quarterly meeting giving it higher rate hike expectations once the previous Quarterly one began showing sings of being potentially discarded by the Fed. Whether it was due to economic data, Fedspeak or other drivers, the process repeated several times. This was an intuitive process by the market, as market participants had no prior evidence of the Fed actually choosing Quarterly meetings for rate moves yet. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How is this relevant for the current curve environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember we stated at the beginning of this document that we were focusing our analysis on spreads where we could short the non-quarterly meeting vs the adjacent quarterly meeting, but only when the Non-Quarterly meeting was the first leg of the spread? \n",
    "\n",
    "In spite of us being on a different environment right now (potential cuts, and PC-bias confirmation by the Fed), cuts are being priced on every consecutive meeting, which means a smoother curve and the potential for Non-Quarterly meetings revisiting the same behavior we saw on the Trasition stage: getting skewed on the front-end as the frontmost Quarterly meeting gets discarded for a potential cut. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is for this reason we believe it to be much safer to trade spreads that meet the criteria stated above, avoiding the risk of the Quarterly leg getting completely discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lets take a look at the data\n",
    "\n",
    "We can split consecutive spreads that involved the particular Non-Quarterly meetings that got skewed ( Apr15, Jul15, Oct15, Apr16 and Jul16), during the transition period in two groups, based on where the Non-Quarterly meeting is placed (as the front or back leg of the spread), and compare them. For simplicity's sake, we will refer to Non-Quarterly meetings as NoPc meetings, and Quarterly meetings as Pc meetings.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the same type of plots we described on the previous section, fixed day to maturity time series, aggregated spread data histograms to compare both type of spreads and look at their distributions, and aggregated spread data fixed day to maturity time series:\n",
    "\n",
    ">- **Fixed Day to Maturity Time Series:** The idea behind using these plots is to take a closer look at how each spread behaved 180 trading days before their expiration and see if there is any pattern (Rollup or Rolldown) as they approach expiration and most importantly, any spikes that indicate the Non-Quarterly leg getting biased.\n",
    "> \n",
    ">\n",
    ">- **Aggregated Data Histograms:** We aggregate all of our 180 days to maturity data (all of the spreads) and plot their distribution, we do this for both sets of spreads separatedly. The idea is to see if there is any difference between them, we want to look at their distribution's shapes, their tails, see if they are centered around different means, etc. \n",
    ">\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- **Aggregated Data Day to Maturity Time Series:** This is simply an aggregation of individual spreads day to maturity time series, we do it by creating an equally weighted \"portfolio\" of all Quarterly-NonQuarterly meeting spreads and repeat the same process for NonQuarterly-Quarterly meeting spreads, its a summary of what we saw individually for each spread on their corresponding day to maturity time series.

They do involve the same type of meetings, but the Pc-NoPc spreads have a fatter left side tail compared to the right side tail of the NoPc-Pc set. The skewing of the Non-Quarterly leg being more apparent on the first set of spreads, due to the discarding of the frontmost Quarterly leg. This does not appear to be as frequent on the NoPc-Pc spreads, we can see that most of the data for this set remains below zero.  \n",

The skewing is not so apparent on NoPc-Pc spreads, they do move but not quite as the first set, and remain on average below zero (Quarterly leg > Non-Quarterly leg). \n",

    "This question is important if we consider our base case, since for these spreads to work, we need the curve to have a smooth slope without seasonal Pc-bias type of effects priced in. As reviewed above, we come from the Full Rate Hike Cycle that spanned from 2017 through 2018, in which most of the rate hike expectations were traded around quarterly meetings. The Press Conference Meeting Bias was strong then and there is still a remnant of it priced in by the market, specially on the front-end of the curve. Thus the question that comes up: \n",
    "\n",
    "Are moves on current consecutive spreads, for the most part, a result of the Quarterly-meeting leg volatility? are we trading with a fragile hedge then, completely exposed to the Quarterly-meeting leg? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Short Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "The short answer is...yes. If we aggregate Consecutive Spreads data since the Christmas rally, without separating 2019 from 2020 spreads and look at the daily settle-to-settle net changes for both their legs [`(Figure 31)`](#Figure_31), we can see that, on average, the PC leg moved on a wider range, with the NoPc leg not only moving on a smaller range but also displaying higher frequency on the same set of prices: its distribution has smaller tails and higher kurtosis (way more concentrated around zero) than the PC leg net change distribution. The pattern becomes a bit clearer if we look at the scatterplot of daily net changes for both legs [`(Figure 32)`](#Figure_31). "

This is not the case for Pre-Hiking Cycle consecutive spreads, where leg share of total net change variance was more uniformly distributed between the Pc and NoPc legs. So yes, the short answer is that, at least for now, its safe to say that the PC leg is much more prevalent on the whole if we look at current spreads vs 2012-2014 spreads, and that PC-bias is still being taken into account.\n",

    ">- We know Non-Quarterly meetings tend to remain very steady when there is no strong market volatility, from January through the first week of March, the market was calm and we can observe that there was little to no difference, on average, between hedging the Pc-leg exposure and not doing so. \n",
    ">\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- Once the market reacted to what was perceived as bad data for US rates (March), the hedge becomes more useful, as in spite of the market pricing cuts more aggressively on Quarterly meetings, Non-Quarterly meetings saw moves on the same direction. This is one point in favor of the hedge clearly, we want it to work, at least partially, when the market gets into a panic. \n",
